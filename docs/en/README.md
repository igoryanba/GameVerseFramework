## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Static Site

The documentation is rendered with **mdBook**.

```bash
# Install mdBook (single Rust binary < 5 MB)
cargo install mdbook

# Build the English book (output in ./book)
mdbook build docs/en

# Serve locally with hot-reload (http://localhost:3001)
mdbook serve docs/en -p 3001
```

CI automatically deploys the static site to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Write in Markdown, use `#` headings and embedded Mermaid diagrams where useful.
2. Keep parity with the Russian docs: when adding a page here, ensure a stub or full translation exists in `../ru` (and vice-versa).
3. Run the documentation linter before committing:

```bash
npm run lint:docs   # vale + markdownlint
```

4. Prefer Mermaid (`.md`) or PlantUML (`.puml`) for technical diagrams.
5. Submit a PR to a branch starting with `docs/*` or label it `documentation`.

_For Russian readers, the most complete docs are located one directory up in `../ru`.  Help translating them is highly appreciated!_
